      <description>Good day my friend. Today i would like about Reproducible Research.
One thing i learnt early in life is that if you understand the definition of a subject, then you have overcome the biggest hurdle there is to ever understanding the concept therein (I hope that makes sense) .
The best definition i could find that explains the concept is this:
 Reproducible Research is the practice of distributing, along with a research publication, all data, software source code, and tools required to reproduce the results discussed in the publication.</description>

      <description>I shall be fine. This here is my entrance into a public life on the internet. Everyone will know who i am by this blog. Do I care? Should I care?&amp;hellip;.You tell me.
Anyways, once in a while i shall come here and write my thoughts about data science. I shall talk about a few tools that have really helped me in my work life as a data person. Most of if not all of what i write about here will be based on the R programming language.</description>
